# The problem FIND ME HOME solves
This platform solves one of the most basic problems that one has faced once in his life. Whenever a person goes to a new city he had a difficult time finding a room or apartment or even if they find one the rent amount would be so high that they are not able to afford it on their own. So, to solve this problem we have developed a platform where a tenant can live in a house in sharing with some other tenants so that the overall cost for living for one person is sufficiently affordable. Not only this owner can give their houses on rent specifying the sharing occupancy, house location, rent amount, features, and the necessary information, and can also view all the tenants dwelling in their house.
